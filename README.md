# Aurelion-Retail-Analytics-End-to-End-Data-Pipeline-ML-Spending-Prediction
This project addresses the critical issue of declining sales and inconsistent operational data within a retail environment. I developed an integrated solution that transforms raw, unreliable data into a coherent, validated, and documented information asset ready for business intelligence and machine learning.

🚀 The Tech Stack
Language: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn) for ETL and modeling.
Visualization: Power BI for strategic dashboarding.
Machine Learning: Linear Regression for customer spending estimation.

🛠️ Data Challenges Resolved (ETL & Cleaning) 
I identified and corrected critical data quality issues that prevented reliable business analysis:
  Structural Errors: Fixed malformed columns, missing values, and heterogeneous formatting.
  Logical Errors: Corrected product misclassifications (e.g., beverages categorized as "Cleaning Supplies").
  Data Pipeline: Developed a Python script to consolidate customer, product, and sales data into clean, analysis-ready datasets.

📈 Model Performance & Business Insights
The project uses a Linear Regression model to predict total customer spend based on purchase history and demographics.
Key Metric: The model achieved an $R^2$ score of 0.47 in its initial phase, providing a foundation for segmenting high-value customers.
Business Impact: By ensuring data integrity, the business can now implement loyalty strategies based on accurate customer lifetime value (CLV) predictions.
